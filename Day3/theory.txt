#Control Flow and logical operators

If-else statement syntax:

If condition:
  Do this
else:
  Do this


Nested if-else syntax:

Two ways:

1:
If condition:
  Do this
  If condition:
    Do this
  else:
    Do this
else:
  Do this

2:
If condition:
  Do A
elif condition:
  Do B 
else:
  Do C

Indentation plays an important role in python. To write only a if block in python we need to give proper indentation to the statement that will execute if the condition is true.

For Example

If condition:
  Do A

Do B


B statement will execute no matter condition is true or false. A on the other hand will execute only when the condition is true



Logical Operators

A and B
C or D
not E
