1. Randomisation 

Python uses Mersenne twister algorithm to achieve randomisation.

`import random`
Random module is the one responsible for generating random values.

To create your own module in python, you use need to create a separate python file and import it in your current file. Now you can access all of your code written in the module python file.

random.randint(max,min) -> generate random integer between max and min and including both

random.random() -> generate random float between 0 and 1 and excluding 1.0


2. Lists
Similar to array
It is collection of data. These data can have same or different data types.
Ex

my_list = ["Hello", "qw", 1]

my_list.append("new Data") -> To add the data


Nested lists:
List that contain list
nested_list = [my_list]
